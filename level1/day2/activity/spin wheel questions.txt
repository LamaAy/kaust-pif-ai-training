They should write down or somehow we show them their question and give them time to think:

1-Mention what types of data you work regularly with (text, audio, combination of multiple?) or no data at all? is it purely structured or purely unstructured or a mixture of both? 

(for people who work with no data at all, think of types of data that if provided to you will significantly influence your work)


2-If i give you data, how will you judge whether the data is clean or trustworthy before using it?

Do you have criteria, or do you simply assume it is correct because it was “given to you”?


3-What consequences can you think about when making decisions with bad, biased, or misunderstood data? How would you know the data is bad or biased or you misunderstood it?

Who gets affected if the data is wrong—the company, customers, finances, or reputation?


4-When comparing reports from different sources, do you trust them equally? (legal, lawyers)

Do you ever ask why two reports about the same topic show different numbers?


5-Could there be hidden bias in the data influencing your decisions? How will you identify bias in data to mitigate this issue? (not necessarily using ML)

Does the data represent everyone fairly, or does it over-represent certain groups and ignore others?

6-When you receive data, do you know where it actually comes from? Do you think it matters knowing the source? justify your answer.

Is it collected internally, purchased, generated by systems, or manually entered—and how confident are you in its reliability?
